### 1.Password Generation:

* First you choose if you want your password to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits or special numbers.

* Then, you choose the length of the password.

* A password alphabet is generated based on the user's answers, which is a string containing the chosen characters.

* Random characters from the password alphabet are selected and combined to form a completely random string according to the user's preferences.

* The final password will be displayed on the console.



### 2.Password Strength Check:

The password's strength is checked based on these points:

* Does it have uppercase letters?

* Does it have lowercase letters?

* Does it have numbers?

* Does it have symbols?

* Is it at least 8 characters long?

* Is it at least 16 characters long?

Based on these criteria, you'll get a score that tells you if your password is weak, medium, good, or great.
